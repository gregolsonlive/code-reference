			<hr class="h1-hr">
			<p class="lead">Helping your employees and their dependents make healthy choices is important. Members’
				health
				is our priority. We offer a wide range of programs, including our clinical management programs, that
				empower
				members to be healthy and stay well.</p>
			<p>The goals and benefits of our Member Health and Wellness programs are to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Encourage preventive healthcare to mitigate future healthcare challenges and costs.</li>
				<li>Support chronic disease management to improve quality of life.</li>
				<li>Provide catastrophic case management for severe, traumatic injury, or life-threatening conditions to
					reduce long-term health risks and costs.</li>
				<li>Educate members about care navigation to help them find high-quality, affordable care that meets
					their
					needs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We believe in a personal approach to healthcare. Our Member Health and Wellness team gets to know the
				members
				they work with to ensure they receive access to care and services when they need it. The programs
				provide:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A personal touch to the administration of healthcare benefits.</li>
				<li>Clinical information and health education to members to inform healthcare decision-making.</li>
				<li>Members with skills for prevention, treatment and recovery processes related to their needs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>More information about our Member health and wellness programs is available on our website at the <a
					href="https://www.capbluecross.com">Capital Blue Cross website</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="sec2">Focusing on Member Health and Wellness</h2>
			<p>Our health and wellness initiatives include educational strategies and programs at employer worksite
				locations and in various locations throughout our service area. By offering programs to members at every
				level of health status we are better able to meet member, employer, and community health needs.</p>
			<h3>Health and wellness programs</h3>
			<p>Many employers realize the best solution to rising healthcare costs is by encouraging their employees to
				stay
				healthy. We offer a comprehensive, proactive, and systematic approach to managing employee health that
				is
				effective for employers, and appealing to and confidential for employees.</p>
			<p>Our comprehensive program is made up of tested and proven efforts and are designed to deliver a better
				return
				on your employee heath investment.</p>
			<p>Our Health and Wellness programs enable employers to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Help employees improve their health.</li>
				<li>Help healthy members reduce their risk of future illness.</li>
				<li>Provide support system of consulting, content, and resources.</li>
				<li>Help your staff operate more efficiently and effectively.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Based on the results of your employees’ health assessments, we make recommendations on health and
				wellness
				programs that are available to your employees based on their unique health needs. Evaluation tools help
				to
				assess the effectiveness of our health and wellness programs.</p>
			<p>Our comprehensive approach to health and wellness addresses the health needs of all your employees,
				including
				at risk individuals and those who suffer from chronic and acute illness. Intervention programs,
				services,
				and activities are matched and made available to employees according to their needs.</p>
			<p>Our population health identification and stratification methodology empowers the clinical team with the
				ability to prioritize members in their populations who are BOTH clinically at-risk AND have impactable
				opportunities that can be acted upon immediately to make a difference in their quality of care. Our
				methodology also assigns a specific category (i.e., Medical (M), Drug (R), Social (S), and Behavioral
				Health
				(BH)) to the members so that our clinical team may identify the resource most appropriate for the
				intervention. The programs are divided into four basic categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Wellness.</li>
				<li>Lifestyle &amp; Behavior Modification.</li>
				<li>Disease/Condition Management.</li>
				<li>Care Management.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="sec3">Wellness</h2>
			<h3>Health assessment</h3>
			<p>A confidential health assessment is a great place to start for your employees to take control of their
				health. A heath assessment:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Generally, takes less than 15 minutes to complete.</li>
				<li>Provides members a wealth of information about their current health status.</li>
				<li>Identifies potential lifestyle risk factors and readiness to change.</li>
				<li>Helps your employees understand what steps to take to improve or maintain their health with a
					personalized plan.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To access the assessment, employees need to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Register for and log in to their secure account on the <a
						href="https://www.capitalbluecross.com/WebSecurity/Login.aspx"
						aria-label="Go to the Capital Blue Cross secure login page">Capital Blue Cross website</a>.</li>
				<li>Select the Wellness menu at the top of the page.</li>
				<li>Select Healthy Blue Rewards.</li>
				<li>Follow the prompts to begin the assessment.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once members complete their assessment, they receive a personal wellness report, recommendations, and
				resources to help address their risk factors.</p>
			<p>The Healthy Blue Rewards platform gives individuals a highly personalized experience, showing them the
				“next
				right thing to do” for their health. Participants can also connect their program with over 100 types of
				activity tracking devices and mobile apps.</p>
			<p>Individuals can also work toward meeting their specific goals with self-guided, digital coaching
				programs.
				These self-paced and trackable journeys include everything from podcasts and quizzes to challenges and
				videos.</p>

			<h3>Healthy Blue Rewards</h3>
			<p>Capital recognizes that each customer has a unique point of view when it comes to wellness-related
				programs.
				Our wellness solution, Healthy Blue Rewards, offers a robust, comprehensive set of engagement services.
			</p>
			<p>Healthy Blue Rewards presents users with their own unique experience, guiding them on their journey to
				the
				“next right thing to do” for their health and well-being. Resources include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>10 self-guided, digital coaching programs.</li>
				<li>Healthy behavior tracking tools.</li>
				<li>Health library and symptom checker.</li>
				<li>NCQA-certified health assessment (available in English and Spanish).</li>
				<li>Personal challenges.</li>
				<li>Personal wellness report.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Employees can access and complete the online health assessment through the portal and app. Upon
				completion,
				participants receive a personal wellness report that includes quantitative data and personalized health
				recommendations. It contains a measure of overall risk and a LifeScore derived using the Whole Life
				Algorithm. This algorithm measures the effect of unhealthy habits over a lifetime and helps members
				understand the increase in life expectancy they may gain by making the recommended changes listed on the
				report. Each report also provides Preventive Health Services Task Force recommendations, a bio-measures
				section, lifestyle improvement recommendations, and a call-to-action section.</p>
			<p>With a completed health assessment and LifeScore, the platform also delivers a highly personalized
				experience
				that intuitively guides participants on the “next right thing to do” for their health in order to drive
				user
				adoption, create a meaningful member experience, and support positive steps toward improved health.</p>
			<p>Large employer with custom medical plans may buy-up to Healthy Blue Rewards Premier. They can customize
				this
				program, including to whom it applies (e.g., employees, employees and spouses). Capabilities include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>27 self-guided, digital coaching programs.</li>
				<li>Corporate challenges.</li>
				<li>Connections (social networking feature).</li>
				<li>In-app messaging.</li>
				<li>Personalized notifications.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With Healthy Blue Rewards Premier, we can display an employer’s logo on the online platform and mobile
				application, as well as customize marketing tiles on the main dashboard page so the programs and
				services
				that are most important to their organization are front and center to their employees. These tiles also
				can
				be refreshed throughout the year in support of strategic goals.</p>
			<p>Please contact your Account Executive for further information on our Healthy Blue Rewards program
				details.

			<h3>VirtualCare</h3>
			<h4 class="brand-orange-heading">VirtualCare: On Demand Doctor Visits by Video</h4>
			<p>A member can turn any place into a doctor’s office any time of day or night with a secure
				telecommunications
				system or other remote, real time monitoring technology. VirtualCare is offered either through the <a

				<li>If a member is travelling.</li>
				<li>If a member is concerned about traveling in bad weather.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The program is cost-effective for your business and for your employees. Video doctor visits cost a
				standard
				fee (consult your plan documents for member costs) and are subject to deductible, coinsurance, or copay
				amounts, depending on your group benefit plan. The amount is generally less than most trips to an urgent
				care center or a run to the emergency room.</p>

			<h3>Emergency room outreach</h3>
			<p>This program identifies members who have had an emergency room (ER) visit and were not immediately
				admitted
				to an acute inpatient facility. Members will receive an automated phone call to provide educational
				information related to available alternative care options. Alternative care options include our Nurse
				Line,
				the member’s primary care provider office, and urgent care centers.</p>
			<p>The educational phone call is not to discourage utilization of the ER, but to provide education on the
				use of
				alternative care options when appropriate.</p>
			<h3>Utilization management programs</h3>
			<h4 class="brand-orange-heading">Concurrent review</h4>
			<p>Concurrent review is done to evaluate and monitor the medical necessity and appropriateness of ongoing
				care
				and services. Our clinicians use standardized clinical criteria and medical policy to perform concurrent
				review. The concurrent review program includes concurrent review, transition of care and readmission
				risk
				assessments, and discharge planning.</p>
			<p>Concurrent review is performed for hospital and facility inpatient admissions. Clinical review with the
				facility’s utilization review/quality improvement department is conducted. Transition of care and
				readmission risk assessment is completed on all inpatient admissions and again on discharge. The
				concurrent
				review team works in collaboration with the hospital discharge planning team to facilitate a smooth
				transition from one level of care to another.</p>
			<p>Concurrent review is initiated for the following services:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Inpatient admissions to an acute care hospital, long-term acute care hospital (LTACH), skilled
					nursing
					facility, or acute rehabilitation hospital.</li>
				<li>Selected ongoing outpatient services that require submission of a treatment plan.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When we are notified, concurrent review will be conducted within 24 hours of an emergency admission or
				the
				next business day following receipt of a treatment plan. A Capital Blue Cross nurse will review the
				member’s
				medical records or treatment plan to evaluate the continued medical necessity and appropriateness of
				treatment and the patient’s response to the treatment.</p>
			<p>Follow-up reviews will be performed periodically to evaluate the medical necessity and appropriateness of
				continued hospitalization and/or ongoing outpatient services.</p>
			<h3>Transition of care program</h3>
			<p>Our Transition of Care (TOC) Program is a care outreach program for members transitioning to home from an
				inpatient facility. Our staff provide outreach calls to members within two business days of discharge to
				ensure a safe transition to home from an inpatient facility and will provide weekly calls for a
				thirty-day
				transition period.</p>
			<p>Our TOC program supports members with a focus on medication reconciliation, health literacy, appointment
				schedule, ensuring all gaps in care have been addressed and will screen for resources or additional
				based on
				identified social determinants of health.</p>
			<h3>Discharge planning</h3>
			<p>Discharge planning is an important step of the concurrent review process. It is performed by the
				concurrent
				review nurses who coordinate the member’s discharge from a facility, arrange for alternative services,
				and
				discuss treatment options with the member or member’s physician, as appropriate.</p>
			<p>Discharge planning looks to promote the use of appropriate outpatient follow-up services and attempts to
				prevent avoidable complications and/or readmissions following inpatient treatment.</p>
			<p>Our concurrent review nurses assess areas such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The member’s living arrangement prior to hospitalization.</li>
				<li>Expected living arrangements after discharge.</li>
				<li>Psychosocial/financial status.</li>
				<li>Assessment of local delivery system.</li>
				<li>Benefit coverage.</li>
				<li>Need for special medication, equipment, and other ancillary supports.</li>
				<li>Additional care needs.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="sec7">Preauthorization</h2>
			<p>The purpose of our medical preauthorization program is to help members receive:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Maximum available benefits, resources, and coverage.</li>
				<li>Benefit review of medically-appropriate treatment to meet members’ individual needs.</li>
				<li>Care by providers delivered in an efficient and effective manner.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Preauthorization determines member eligibility at the time of the request, benefit coverage, and the
				medical
				necessity of the proposed service.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Our preauthorization process involves the evaluation of requests for service before delivery of
					care.
				</li>
				<li>Physicians work with our specially trained clinicians to facilitate the coordination and provision
					of
					medically-necessary healthcare services in a timely and efficient manner. .</li>
				<li>We use nationally-recognized medical necessity criteria and medical policy to make medical necessity
					and
					appropriateness determinations to promote appropriate use of services.</li>
				<li>In-network providers complete the preauthorization process for members. .</li>
				<li>Out-of-network providers may contact us for preauthorization; however, when a member accesses an
					out-of-network provider, the member is ultimately responsible for obtaining a required
					preauthorization.
					.</li>
				<li>When a service or procedure is performed by an out-of-network provider without obtaining
					preauthorization, the service or procedure is reviewed retrospectively for medical necessity.</li>
				<li>When in doubt, call the Member Services number on the back of the ID card to validate
					preauthorization
					requirements because the majority of our health products have a “<strong>preauthorization
						penalty</strong>” (i.e., the member may have to pay a penalty if a service requiring
					preauthorization is not preauthorized).</li>
				<li>HMO medical care is coordinated through the member’s PCP. An in-network provider must be used. For
					HMO
					members, preauthorization for out-of-network care is a necessity. If the service is not
					preauthorized,
					the claim is not paid and the member is financially responsible for the service.</li>
				<li>Select outpatient services require the provider to submit a treatment plan to us for evaluation of
					medical necessity and appropriateness. A preauthorization nurse evaluates the request and treatment
					plan
					to determine medical necessity and appropriateness of continued care. Care may be authorized for a
					specific number of units (i.e., visits) before additional subsequent review is required.</li>
				<li>To obtain preauthorization, providers may access our online preauthorization application on our
					provider
					portal. This will provide access to perform a preauthorization inquiry, request preauthorization for
					Inpatient and Outpatient services, request a preauthorization for a member to see a
					non-participating
					provider.</li>
				<li>For complete listings of specific services requiring preauthorization, check your group contract, or
					online via our preauthorization single source code list available via our provider portal. Members
					may
					check their Benefits Booklet.</li>

			<h2 id="sec9">Formulary for prescription drugs</h2>
			<p>Our formulary preface contains important information about our Rx products. The formulary is a
				continually
				updated list of medications that represents the current judgment of physicians and pharmacists in the
				treatment of disease and preservation of health. Medications in all therapeutic categories are reviewed
				based on safety, effectiveness, and cost by our Pharmacy &amp; Therapeutics (P &amp; T) Committee. The
				formulary is a key reference tool for physicians when prescribing drug therapies for their patients.</p>
			<h3>How to find formulary information:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Visit the <a href="https://www.capbluecross.com">Capital Blue Cross website</a>.</li>
				<li>Log in to your secure group portal.</li>
				<li>Go to Find.</li>
				<li>Select Drugs to go to the Prescription drug benefits.</li>
				<li>Select the formulary link for the Group Coverage from Your Employer column.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our Rx products and formularies are designed to recognize four categories (or tiers) of prescription
				medications:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Generic Preferred (tier one/GP) and Generic Nonpreferred (tier two/GNP): <span
						style="display: block;">Drugs containing the same active ingredient(s) as their corresponding
						brand
						name drug and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for therapeutic equivalency to
						their brand name product. (Please note not all strengths and formulations of generic drugs have
						the
						same tier status.)</span>.</li>
				<li>Brand Preferred (tier three/BP): <span style="display: block;">Drugs that have been reviewed by
						Capital
						Blue Cross’ P &amp; T Committee and found to have therapeutic advantage or overall value over
						nonpreferred brands, factoring safety, effectiveness, and cost.</span>.</li>
				<li>Brand Nonpreferred (tier four/BNP): <span style="display: block;">Drugs that have been reviewed by
						Capital Blue Cross’ P &amp; T Committee and found not to have significant therapeutic advantage
						or
						overall value over alternative generic, preferred brands, or over-the-counter
						medications.</span>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: Not all plans include a two-tier generic benefit with a different
				copayment/coinsurance for each generic tier. For plans that do not have a two-tier generic benefit, the
				generic copayment/coinsurance will be applied to generic preferred and generic nonpreferred drugs.)</p>
			<p>For most Rx product designs, members’ copayment or coinsurance amounts differ depending on whether a drug
				is
				generic, preferred brand, or nonpreferred brand.</p>
			<h2 id="sec10">Prior Authorization for Prescription Drugs</h2>
			<p>Rx products include a prior authorization requirement for certain types of prescription drugs. These
				drugs
				require prior authorization before members can obtain them as a covered benefit.</p>
			<p>The purpose of prior authorization is to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Encourage the use of clinically appropriate and cost-effective medications.</li>
				<li>Avoid misuse or abuse of prescription drugs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Drugs requiring prior authorization are identified in our formulary by Prior Authorization Required
				(PAR),
				noted after the drug name. Examples of types of prescriptions requiring prior authorization include, but
				are
				not limited to, topical acne products and growth hormones.</p>
			<p>The prescribing physician or pharmacist must provide supporting clinical information to our pharmacy
				benefit
				manager, Prime Therapeutics, in order for the drug to be considered for coverage. Medications requiring
				prior authorization will not be covered if prior authorization is not obtained before filling the
				medication.</p>
			<h3>Step therapy</h3>
			<p>When many different drugs are available for treating the same medical condition, a process called step
				therapy is used to support and encourage the most appropriate drug treatment.</p>
			<p>Our Rx products are designed so first line medications must be tried for some conditions before allowing
				coverage for second line medications. Drugs requiring step therapy are identified in the Capital Blue
				Cross
				formulary by ST. For example, a first line osteoporosis medication should be used before prescribing a
				second line brand osteoporosis medication.</p>
			<p>For certain medical conditions, the prescribing physician or pharmacist can obtain authorization by
				contacting the Prime Therapeutics Prior Authorization Department.</p>
			<p>For prescribing physician or dispensing pharmacist use only:</p>
			<p>Prime Therapeutics, LLC <span style="display: block;">Phone: <a href="tel:8666882242"
						aria-label="Call Prime Therapeutics">866.688.2242</a></span> <span style="display: block;">Fax:
					<a href="tel:8552128110" aria-label="Fax Prime Therapeutics">855.212.8110</a></span></p>
			<h3>Drug quantity management for prescription drugs</h3>
			<p>Some prescription drugs may be subject to drug quantity management under your group Rx product, meaning a
				specific quantity of medication is authorized to be dispensed over a specific duration or per
				prescription.
				These drugs are designated by Quantity Level Limit (QLL) in the Capital Blue Cross formulary. For
				example,
				the standard quantity limit for medication may be six (6) tabs per thirty (30) days.</p>
			<h2 id="sec11">Generic substitution policy for prescription drugs</h2>
			<p>Your group’s Rx product contains one of the following policies regarding generic drugs substitutions for
				brand prescription medication. Check your group contract to identify which of the following policies
				applies
				to your group coverage:</p>
			<h3>Generic drug substitution policies</h3>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-3">
					<p>Mandatory generic substitution</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>If the prescribing physician indicates “Dispense as Written” (DAW) for a brand name drug, or if
						the
						member requests a brand name drug when a generic is available, the member is responsible for the
						cost difference (also known as ancillary charge) between the brand name medication and the
						generic
						medication in addition to the member’s applicable brand copayment/coinsurance, up to the
						original
						cost of the brand name medication.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-3">
					<p>Restricted generic substitution</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>If a member requests a name brand product when a generic is available, the member is responsible
						for
						the cost difference between the brand name medication and its generic cost in addition to the
						member’s applicable brand copayment/coinsurance, up to the original cost of the brand name
						medication.</p>
					<p>If the prescribing physician indicates “DAW,” then the member pays the applicable copayment for
						the
						brand product and is not required to pay the additional ancillary charge.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h2 id="sec12">Benefit exclusions/limitations for prescription drugs</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Some medications listed may not be covered under the prescription drug benefit based on the drug
					plan
					design purchased by the member or group.</li>
				<li>Refer to your group contract for the specific exclusions and limitations for your prescription drug
					product.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Utilization review program for prescription drugs</h3>
			<p>The purpose of Drug Utilization Review (DUR) is to identify potential drug interactions, therapeutic
				duplications, and other safety concerns.</p>
			<p>As part of your Rx product, each member’s complete prescription claim profile is captured—regardless of
				how
				many in-network pharmacies the member uses.</p>
			<p>The DUR program helps to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Protect the patient from an adverse event.</li>
				<li>Optimize prescribing and dispensing.</li>
				<li>Improve quality of care for the patient.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The DUR program provides a back-up for important drug and member-specific pharmaceutical care concerns.
				The
				review includes interaction with the patient, pharmacist, and physician, if necessary, to ensure the
				patient
				receives the most appropriate medication while managing costs.</p>
